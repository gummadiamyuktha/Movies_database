# 🎬 Movies SQL Project

This is a simple SQL project that creates a **Movies** database with two tables:

- **MOVIES** → stores movie details like title, release year, genre, director, and lead actor.  
- **hero** → stores actor details like name, age, and birth year.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside
- SQL script to create tables (`MOVIES` and `hero`)
- Insert sample data for popular Telugu movies and actors
- Example queries using:
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
  - `DISTINCT`, `BETWEEN`
  - `JOIN` between movies and heroes
  - `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for duplicates
  - Aggregate functions like `COUNT` and `MAX`

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open MySQL or PostgreSQL.
2. Create or switch to a database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE movies_db;
   USE movies_db;
3.Run the SQL file:
   SOURCE SONGSMOOD.sql;
4.Execute the queries to explore the data.

🎯 Learning Goals
Practice SQL basics with real-world style data
Learn filtering, sorting, and aggregation
Understand table joins between movies and actors
